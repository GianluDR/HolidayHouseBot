# Holiday House Telegram Bot
University Group Project - Development of a Chatbot for Home Automation Vacation Home Management.

Our goal was to provide users with a virtual assistant that could facilitate the management of their vacation homes and offer recommendations on nearby restaurants, bars, and other places of interest.

Technologies Used:

-JavaScript: Frontend development and user interface interaction logic.
-Dialogflow: Use of Dialogflow, a development framework for chatbots, to implement the conversational system.
-Geolocation API: Integration of geolocation API to provide accurate information about nearby places of interest.
-JSON for Database: Use of JSON files for database data management and organization.
-Node.js: Implementing the Node.js runtime environment to execute JavaScript code on the server.
-This experience allowed me to gain valuable skills in teamwork, collaboration, and integration of different technologies to create a functional, user-centered product.

PLEASE NOTE to test the application use aaa001,aaa002,aaa003,aaa004,aaa005 as the house code.

-A short presentation of the case study and the technologies used is given in the file 'CasaVacanzaPresentazione'(Language: Italian).

-The agent created with dialogflow is inside the zipper 'CasaVacanzaAgente'

-The application is inside the bot folder
